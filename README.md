### Command Lines

+ A **command line** is also called a terminal. It is a texted-based interface that commands are entered into. 
  - *Linux is an example of this type of terminal*
  - *When a command is entered, it is stored into a history that can be referenced at anytime to shorten the time spent within the terminal.*
 
+ The way to **open a terminal** differs based on the **operating system** of the computer in use.
  - *Typically, there are not many steps to opening a terminal, making the process overall intuitive.*

+ A terminal needs a **shell** to determine how it will operate.
  - *The Bourne again shell is one of the most common examples of a shell.*
  - *There are a number of shells available that could be utilized to define how a terminal behaves.*
